# Beryllium Anti-Malware
Beryllium Anti-Malware is a hosts-based anti-malware filter list with an emphasis on documenting and combatting rogue browser extensions and search engines.

I will also be using this repository to document potentially malicious extensions and their suspicious behaviors, as well as which extensions connect to which of the domains on the list. Documentation of the rogue search engines themselves is also being worked on.

Please bear in mind that I am updating this manually, so updates may take time.
