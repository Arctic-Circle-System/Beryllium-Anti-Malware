# Beryllium Anti-Malware
Beryllium Anti-Malware is a hosts-based anti-malware filter list with an emphasis on documenting and combatting rogue browser extensions and search engines.

I will also be using this repository to document potentially malicious extensions and their suspicious behaviors, as well as which extensions connect to which of the domains on the list.
